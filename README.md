Hello! I am a TypeScript developer based near Sydney Australia.

By day I am over at [Simply Wall St](https://simplywall.st) building new features for everyday investors. By night I take on small contract and hobby projects to continue pushing my capabilities and doing what I love - creating amazing software that delivers value to individuals and businesses.
